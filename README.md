# About
The main purpose of this project is to build a fully functioning JavaScript web application. This application lets users view a list of pokemon and see specific details about each pokemon. The application employs touch events for mobile users, which allows swiping between pokemon when in modal view. The application also features a search bar, where users can filter specific pokemon they are searching for. 

The main purpose of this project is to build a fully functioning REST API. This application allows users to register and login to the application. After logging in, the users can then look at all the movies in the database, along with corresponding genres and directors. The user can change his account information and also deregister if they wish to. The full list of endpoints for the API can be seen in the root "/" endpoint, which will display a documentation HTML file.
