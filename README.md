# About
The main purpose of this project is to build a fully functioning REST API. This application allows users to register and login to the application. After logging in, the users can then look at all the movies in the database, along with corresponding genres and directors. The user can change his account information and also deregister if they wish to. The full list of endpoints for the API can be seen in the root "/" endpoint, which will display a documentation HTML file.
